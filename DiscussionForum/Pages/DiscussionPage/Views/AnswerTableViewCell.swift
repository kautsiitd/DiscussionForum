I wanted to ask, they say that mithril is one of the strongest metals and whatnot, I always wondered if Fingolfin had worn mithril during his battle with Morgoth, would he have survived or maybe last longer to injure him further. I know that morgoth is a valar and holds immense power but would mithril have helped or would it have made no difference."
